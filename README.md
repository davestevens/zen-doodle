# Zen Doodle

Based on a gif i saw on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/4bm5yz/zen_doodle/).

## Shape

`Shape` takes a list of points (at least 3). From these points the inner structure is built using the `percentage` option. `percentage` is used for calculating the position of the next point.

Reversing the order of the points results in the pattern being draw clocksize or anti-clockwise.

See `assets/about.json` for example shapes.

## Development

Tasks have been created in the `package.json` file, run `npm install` to install all required packages.
